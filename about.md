I am working in the field of finite element methods and isogeometric analysis with emphasis on method development for problems involving shape and topological optimization.

I am also interested in GPU and parallel computing and have been working on the development of a framework for efficient parallel implementation of isogeometric and finite element analysis. Besides development for numerical simulations, I also love making animations using Python+Plotly for developing intuition in the workings of FEM and IGA.

I also love the open-source community and use FEniCS as my primary package for performing finite element simulations.
