Typora is my favourite markdown editor. It is opensource, clean and minimal. If you know and understand a little bit about programming in CSS that you can also modify its look to your liking. In this post I am going to show you the exact settings that helped me get as close as possible to the actual look and feel of the Moving theme on the website. 

 ## Installation

- Go to the website and download and install the package: https://typora.io/

- To match the look of the theme you have to install the Bitter font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter

- After the installation of the font is complete you have to download and install the following file to your themes folder. Follow the instructions in the README file.https://github.com/iitrabhi/typora-gitbook-theme

  Goto Preferences → Appearance → Open theme folder and then paste the theme files here.

- Once you have pasted the theme you will get the option in the dropdown menu in Preferences → Appearance. Select Gitbook Slate and now you have the layout similar to this![image-20210105104246331](/assets/images/image-20210105104246331.png)

- Next, you have to go to Preferences → Images and use the following settings:

- The last thing that you need to do now before publishing the post is to remove the double dots from the path of your image file.

  ![image-20210105104558912](/assets/images/image-20210105104558912.png)

- This step is necessary to show images on the website. It will however unfortunately remove the preview of the image from Typora.
